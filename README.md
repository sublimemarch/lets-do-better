@rubymonsters also put out [diversitytickets.org](https://diversitytickets.org/) an app to make diversifying conference easier. [github repo](https://github.com/rubymonsters/diversity_ticketing)

## accessbility of information about the event on the event website and social media accounts

# Ways we can do better:
1. When creating a group or planning an event, consider carefully how you name it. Instead of "Women in Tech", consider something that includes all marginalized genders. 

2. Always provide [pronoun buttons or stickers](https://dev.to/sublimemarch/an-organizers-guide-to-pronoun-buttons-afb) for attendees. Consider the ratio of pronouns to get, and make sure you have blanks and extras. This article is also available in [print ready zine form](https://sublimemarch.itch.io/an-organizers-guide-to-using-pronoun-buttons) so you can easily share it with all of your co-organizers!

3. Are gender neutral bathrooms available? Do all bathrooms have access to the same types of personal hygiene supplies?
