# Some marginalized identites we need to do a better job of including at tech events.
- trans people, nonbinary people
- neurodiversity
- visible disability
- invisible disability
- race and ethnicity
- people with dependents (children, elderly)
- dietary restrictions
- national origin and documentation status

# Some things to consider when planning an event:
- meals
- allergies
- illnesses
- media consent
- children
- bathrooms
- accessibility services
- translation
- drugs, alcohol
- trigger/content warnings
- codes of conduct
- consent, respect
- differing tolerence for socialization and stimulation

# Ways we can do better:
1. When creating a group or planning an event, consider carefully how you name it. Instead of "Women in Tech", consider something that includes all marginalized genders. 

2. Always provide [pronoun buttons or stickers](https://dev.to/sublimemarch/an-organizers-guide-to-pronoun-buttons-afb) for attendees. Consider the ratio of pronouns to get, and make sure you have blanks and extras. This article is also available in [print ready zine form](https://sublimemarch.itch.io/an-organizers-guide-to-using-pronoun-buttons) so you can easily share it with all of your co-organizers!

3. Are gender neutral bathrooms available? Do all bathrooms have access to the same types of personal hygiene supplies?
